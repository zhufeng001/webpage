use and require specific units for these values, and those which treat them
as arbitrary numbers. The group which treats the values as arbitrary numbers
includes the range widgets (scrollbars and scales, the progress bar widget,
and the spin button widget). These widgets are all the widgets which are
typically "adjusted" directly by the user with the mouse or keyboard. They
will treat the lower and upper values of an adjustment as a range within
which the user can manipulate the adjustment's value. By default, they will
only modify the value of an adjustment.</p><p>The other group includes the text widget, the viewport widget,
the compound list widget, and the scrolled window widget. All of these
widgets use pixel values for their adjustments. These are also all widgets
which are typically "adjusted" indirectly using scrollbars. While all
widgets which use adjustments can either create their own adjustments or use
ones you supply, you'll generally want to let this particular category of
widgets create its own adjustments. Usually, they will eventually override
all the values except the value itself in whatever adjustments you give
them, but the results are, in general, undefined (meaning, you'll have to
read the source code to find out, and it may be different from widget to
widget).</p><p>Now, you're probably thinking, since text widgets and viewports
insist on setting everything except the value of their adjustments, while
scrollbars will only touch the adjustment's value, if you share an
adjustment object between a scrollbar and a text widget, manipulating the
scrollbar will automagically adjust the text widget? Of course it will! Just
like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">
  # creates its own adjustments
  viewport = gtk.Viewport()
  # uses the newly-created adjustment for the scrollbar as well
  vscrollbar = gtk.VScrollbar(viewport.get_vadjustment())
