<h3>Introduction and Motivation</h3>

<p>
On Unix and Unix-like systems, hardware devices are accessed through
special files (also called device files or nodes) located in the
<code>/dev</code> directory. These files are read from and written to just
like normal files, but instead of writing and reading data on a disk, they
communicate directly with a kernel driver which then communicates with the
hardware. There are many online resources describing <code>/dev</code> files in
more detail. Traditonally, these special files were created at install time
by the distribution, using the <code>mknod</code> command. In recent years,
Linux systems began using <code>udev</code> to manage these
<code>/dev</code> files at runtime. For example, <code>udev</code> will
create nodes when devices are detected and delete them when devices are removed
(including hotplug devices at runtime). This way,
the <code>/dev</code> directory contains (for the most part) only entries
for devices which actually exist on the system at the current time, as
opposed to devices which <i>could</i> exist.
</p>

<p> Udev also has a powerful scripting interface (with files commonly located
in <code>/etc/udev/rules.d</code>) which distributors (and end users) often
use to customize the way device nodes are created. Customizable properties include file permissions,
location within
the filesystem, and symbolic links. As could be imagined, this customization
can make it difficult for application writers to locate specific device
files (or
types of devices), because they could be easily moved by modifying the
<code>udev</code>
rules. For example, in recent years, the <code>js</code> (joystick) nodes
were moved from <code>/dev</code> to <code>/dev/input</code>. Many older
programs explicitly opened devices in <code>/dev</code> (for example
<code>/dev/js0</code>). When these older programs are run today, and
try to open <code>/dev/js0</code>, they will simply not work
since <code>/dev/js0</code> has been moved.
</p>

<p>
Another problem is that when using multiple devices of the same type, the
order in which they appear in <code>/dev</code> is not guaranteed to be the
same every time. This often happens with USB devices. Some USB devices will
show up in a different order after a reboot even when plugged into the same
USB ports. I've
observed this directly with FTDI USB serial ports. For example, with two of
these ports plugged in, udev will create <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code> and
<code>/dev/ttyUSB1</code>, but the order is undefined. (This particular
problem can be worked around by creating <code>udev</code> rules which create
symlinks based on something like a device serial number).
</p>

<p>
Another issue is that when dealing with things like HID devices, simply knowing
that an entry such as <code>/dev/hidraw0</code> exists tells you nothing about
what kind of device it is. It could be any type of HID device.
</p>

<h3>The Solution - sysfs</h3>

<p>
Sysfs is a virtual filesystem exported by the kernel, similar to
<code>/proc</code>. The files in Sysfs contain information about devices and
drivers. Some files in Sysfs are even writable, for configuration and
control of devices attached to the system. Sysfs is always mounted on <code>/sys</code>.
</p>

<p>
The directories in Sysfs contain the heirarchy of devices, as they are
attached to the computer. For example, on my computer, the
<code>hidraw0</code> device is located under:
</p><blockquote>
<code>/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.2/usb1/1-5/1-5.4/1-5.4:1.0/0003:04D8:003F.0001/hidraw/hidraw0</code>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on the path, the device is attached to (roughly, starting from
the end) configuration 1 <code>(:1.0)</code> of the device attached to port
number 4 of device 1-5, connected to USB controller 1 (usb1), connected to
the PCI bus. While interesting, this directory path doesn't do us very much
good, since it's dependent on how the hardware is physically connected to
the computer.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, Sysfs also provides a large number of symlinks, for easy access
to devices
without having to know which PCI and USB ports they are connected to. In
<code>/sys/class</code> there is a directory for each different class of
device. My <code>/sys/class</code> directory looks like this:
</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>
alan@ato:/sys/class$ ls
<font color="blue">
atm        graphics       ieee1394_protocol  printer       thermal
backlight  hidraw         input              rfkill        tty
bdi        hwmon          mem                scsi_device   usb
block      i2c-adapter    misc               scsi_disk     vc
bluetooth  ide_port       net                scsi_generic  video_output
dma        ieee1394       pci_bus            scsi_host     vtconsole
dmi        ieee1394_host  power_supply       sound
firmware   ieee1394_node  ppdev              spi_master
</font></code></pre></blockquote>
<p>
Following our example of using <code>hidraw</code>, one can see that there is a
<code>hidraw</code> directory here. Inside it is a symbolic link named
<code>hidraw0</code> which points to
</p>
<blockquote><code>
 ../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.2/usb1/1-5/1-5.4/1-5.4:1.0/0003:04D8:003F.0001/hidraw/hidraw0
</code></blockquote>
<p>
This way, hidraw devices can easily be found under <code>/sys/class/hidraw
</code> without knowing anything about their USB or PCI heirarchy. It would be
a good exercise to examine the contents of the <code>/sys</code> directory,
especially <code>/sys/bus</code>, <code>/sys/class</code>, and
<code>/sys/subsystem</code>. Since much of <code>/sys</code> is symbolic
links, it may also benefit you to use the utility <code>realpath</code> to show
physical directory paths, as opposed to symbolic link paths. This is useful when
trying to find the actual parent directories of device directories. For
example, to find the containing USB device entry for <code>hidraw0</code>,
one could use <code>realpath</code> to do something like the following:
</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>
alan@ato:/sys$ <b>cd /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw0/</b>

<h3>libudev</h3>

<p>
Because it's cumbersome and error-prone to walk the Sysfs tree from within
an application's code,
there's a convenient library called <code>libudev</code> to do this task for
us. Currently, the closest thing to a manual for <code>libudev</code> is the
gtk-doc-genereated API reference located here:
</p>
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/libudev/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/hotplug/libudev/</a>
</blockquote>
<p>The documentation there is not really enough for the average developer to get
started, so hopefully this guide and its example will make it a bit easier.
</p>

<p>
For the remainder of this guide, we'll be using <code>libudev</code> to
access <code>hidraw</code> devices. Using libudev, we'll be able to inspect
the devices, including their Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), serial
number, and device strings, without ever opening the device. Further,
<code>libudev</code> will tell us exactly where inside <code>/dev</code> the
device's node is located, giving the  application a robust and
distribution-independent way of accessing the device.
</p>

<p>
Building with libudev is as simple as including <code>libudev.h</code> and
passing <code>-ludev</code> to the compiler to link with the
<code>libudev</code> library.
</p>

<p>
The first example gets a list of the <code>hidraw</code> objects connected
to the system, and
prints out their device node path, manufacturer strings, and serial number.
To do this, a <code>udev_enumerate</code> object is created, and the text
string <code>"hidraw"</code> is specified to be used as its filter.
<code>libudev</code> will then return a list of <code>udev_device</code>
objects which match the filter. In our example, this will be a list of all
the <code>hidraw</code> devices attached to the system. The example code performs
the following tasks:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Initialize the library, getting handle to a <code>struct udev</code>.</li>
	<li>Enumerate the devices</li>
	<li>For each device:
	
	<ol>
		<li>Print its node name (eg: <code>/dev/hidraw0</code>).</li>
		<li>Find the ancestor node which represents the actual USB
		    device (as opposed to the device's HID interface).</li>
		<li>Print the USB device information (IDs, serial number,
		    etc).</li>
		<li>Unreference the device object.</li>
	
	</ol></li>
	<li>Unreference the enumeration object.</li>
	<li>Unreference the udev object.</li>
	
</ol>

<p>
On my system, I have a Microchip Application Demo connected, so my output is

propagated through to userspace as UTF-8):

</code></pre></blockquote>


<p><b>Some Notes on libudev</b></p>

<p>
Before moving on, it seems appropriate to mention some important things
about libudev.
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>libudev</code>'s functions are string-based. Since the data is
coming directly from sysfs (which contains (virtual) files with text in
them), all the data which comes from <code>libudev</code> is in text string
format.
This means that the user will have to manually convert strings to integer types
if desired. </li>
<li>The strings passed to <code>udev_device_get_sysattr_value()</code>
correspond to file names in the sysfs tree. In this example,
<code>idVendor</code> corresponds to

<blockquote><code>
	/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:12.2/usb1/1-5/1-5.4/idVendor
</code></blockquote>

which can also be reached as (using the sysfs symlinks)

<blockquote><code>
	/sys/bus/usb/devices/1-5.4/idVendor
</code></blockquote>
In order to find out which properties are available for a device, simply
find the device in sysfs, and look at which files exist. On my system, my
<code>/sys/bus/usb/devices/1-5.4/</code> directory looks like the following:

<blockquote><pre><code>
<font color="blue">1-5.4:1.0</font>            bDeviceSubClass     configuration  idProduct     remove
authorized           bmAttributes        descriptors    idVendor      serial
avoid_reset_quirk    bMaxPacketSize0     dev            manufacturer  speed
bcdDevice            bMaxPower           devnum         maxchild      <font color="lightblue">subsystem</font>
bConfigurationValue  bNumConfigurations  devpath        <font color="blue">power</font>         uevent
bDeviceClass         bNumInterfaces      <font color="lightblue">driver</font>         product       urbnum
bDeviceProtocol      busnum              <font color="blue">ep_00</font>          quirks
version
</code></pre></blockquote>
Any non-directory file or link in that directory can be queried with
<code>udev_device_get_sysattr_value()</code> to determine the properties of
the device.
</li>
<li>All the strings which come from sysfs are Unicode UTF-8. It is an error
to assume that they are ASCII.</li>
<li><code>libudev</code> is reference counted. Instead of specifically
allocating and freeing objects, ref() and unref() functions (such as
<code>udev_ref()</code> and <code>udev_unref()</code>) are used for keeping track of how many
references to an object exist. When the reference count drops to zero, the
object is freed. Functions which return a new object return it with a
reference count of 1, so calling its unref() function will effectively free
it. See the <code>libudev</code> documentation (referenced above). </li>
</ul>

<h3><code>libudev</code> - Monitoring Interface</h3>

<p>
<code>libudev</code> also provides a monitoring interface. The monitoring
interface will report events to the application when the status of a device
changes. This is useful for receiving notification when devices are connected
or disconnected from the system. Like the enumeration interface described above,
the monitoring interface also provides a filtering mechanisn, so that an
application can subscribe to only events with which it is concerned. For
example, if an application added <code>"hidraw"</code> to the filter,
only events concerning <code>hidraw</code> devices would be delivered
to the application. When a device changes state, the
<code>udev_monitor_receive_device()</code> function will return a handle to
a <code>udev_device</code> which represents the object which changed. The returned object
can then be queried with the <code>udev_device_get_action()</code> function
to determine which action occurred. The actions are returned as the
following strings:
<ul>
<li><code>add</code> - Device is connected to the system
<li><code>remove</code> - Device is disconnected from the system
<li><code>change</code> - Something about the device changed
<li><code>move</code> - Device node was moved, renamed, or re-parented
</ul>

<p>
The <code>udev_monitor_receive_device()</code> function is blocking. That is,
when called, program execution will stop until there is an event to be
returned. This use case does not seem to be very useful. Fortunately, the
<code>udev_monitor</code> object can provide a file descriptor, suitable for
use with the <code>select()</code> system call. <code>select()</code> can be
used to determine if a call to <code>udev_monitor_receive_device()</code>
will block, providing a way to receive events in a non-blocking way.
</p>

<p>
The following code shows an example of the <code>libudev</code> monitor
interface. The example runs a loop which executes <code>select()</code> to
determine if there has been an event. If there has, it calls
<code>udev_monitor_receive_device()</code> to receive the event and prints
it out. At the end of the loop it
<code>sleep()</code>'s for 250 milliseconds. In real life, a simple program
like this would be just fine to not use <code>select()</code> and just let
<code>udev_monitor_receive_device()</code> block, but it is written this way
to show an example of how to get non-blocking behavior from the
<code>libudev</code> monitoring interface.

<p>
It's important to note that when using monitoring and enumeration together,
that monitoring should be enabled <i>before</i> enumeration. This way, any
events (for example devices being attached to the system) which happen
during enumeration will not be lost. If enumeration is done before
monitoring is enabled, any device attached between the time the enumeration
happens and when monitoring starts will be missed. The algorithm
should be:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Set up monitoring.</li>
	<li>Enumerate devices (optionally opening desired devices).</li>
	<li>Begin checking the monitoring interface for events.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The example file (linked at the end of this document) uses enumeration and
monitoring together, and follows this algorithm.
The code above shows <i>only</i> monitoring, for simplicity.
</p>



<p><b>Output</b></p>

<p>
The code above will run forever. (Terminate it with <code>Ctrl-C</code>). With
the above section of code running, the following data is printed out as I
disconnect and reconnect my HID device (note that a . character is printed
every 250 milliseconds):
</p>
<blockquote><pre><code>
...........................
select() says there should be data
Got Device
   Node: /dev/hidraw0
   Subsystem: hidraw
   Devtype: (null)
   Action: <b>remove</b>
.............
select() says there should be data
Got Device
   Node: /dev/hidraw0
   Subsystem: hidraw
   Devtype: (null)
   Action: <b>add</b>
......^C
</code></pre></blockquote>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
The libudev interface is very useful for creating robust software which
needs to access a specific hardware device or monitor the real-time connection and
disconnection status of hot-pluggable hardware. I hope you find this document
useful. The full source code of the demo is available through the following
